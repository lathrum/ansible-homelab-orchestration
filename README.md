[Documentation](https://dylancyclone.github.io/ansible-homelab-orchestration/)

Ansible Homelab Orchestration is a project that sets up and installs applications on your homelab using Docker.

It can also leverage [Traefik](https://dylancyclone.github.io/ansible-homelab-orchestration/applications/traefik) to provide automatic SSL certificates and reverse proxying for [external access](https://dylancyclone.github.io/ansible-homelab-orchestration/guides/dns-access/) to any/all of your applications.

## AI Generated Code

During the development of this project I did not use any AI coding agents or tools. Some PRs written by others have been co-authored by coding agents, but every single PR is hand reviewed for accuracy. I have no issue with using AI tools to assist or debug, but due to the nature of orchestrating a homelab, AI cannot be trusted to drive development and any AI slop PRs will be rejected.
